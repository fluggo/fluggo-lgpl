A collection of libraries written long ago by Brian Crowell in C# for .NET/Mono.

Currently these libraries cover:

* Easy IL-level code generation
* Customizable bit-level serialization
* Two-way streaming communication over one stream, sort of a generic SCTP

This exists mainly as a memory, but I've been known to use some of the classes from Fluggo.dll in other work, particularly the very useful AsynchronousQueue class.
